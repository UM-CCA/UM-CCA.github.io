We, the members of Children’s Craniofacial Association at the University of Michigan, in order to empower and give hope to individuals and families affected by facial differences, do hereby establish this organization at the esteemed University of Michigan.

Children’s Craniofacial Association is a nonprofit organization that addresses the medical, financial, psychosocial, emotional, and educational concerns relating to craniofacial conditions in children nationally and internationally.

Children’s Craniofacial Association at the University of Michigan is affiliated with the national non-profit organization Children’s Craniofacial Association.

Our mission is to empower and give hope to individuals and families affected by facial differences, and we envision a world where all people are accepted for who they are, not how they look.
